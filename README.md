# Words Per Minute

A simple timed typing test built with React, Redux, and Typescript.

I acknowledge that the code for this project is probably WAY more complex than it needs to be for the functionality, but my goal was to practice integrating Typescript with React and Redux, so as much as possible I used Redux for managing state and created interfaces and types for all of the actions and components, so it definitely feels verbose.
